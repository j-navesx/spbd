# Final Project for Big Data Processing System
## Objective
Hazardous air pollutants, also known as toxic air pollutants or air toxics, are those pollutants that are known or suspected to cause cancer or other serious health effects, such as reproductive effects or birth defects, or adverse environmental effects. The USA Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) tracks 187 air pollutants. See https://www.epa.gov/haps/ for more information.
## Work Done
Using the [Datasets](data/) we use `python` with the following infrastructures:
1. `Map-Reduce`
2. `Spark`
3. `Spark Dataframes`
4. `Spark SQL`
5. `Hive`
With this infrastructures we answer the following questions:
1. Which states have more/less monitors?
2. Which counties have the best/worst air quality?
3. Which states have the best/worst air quality in each year?
4. For each state, what is the average distance (in km) of the monitors in that state to the state center?
5. How many sensors there are per quadrant (NW, NE, SE, SW) in each state?
## Execution
To execute find the folders for the respective infrastructures and run the python notebook using `Jupyter`
